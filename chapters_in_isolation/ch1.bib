                   for the automatic modelling and symbolic coding of
                   intonation patterns. The algorithms are implemented
                   as external functions (respectively a C program and a
                   Perl script), which are seamlessly integrated into
                   the Praat speech manipulation software by means of
                   the recently proposed plugin facility for Praat.
                   Pitch detection is carried out using a subroutine to
                   calculate optimal values of maximum and minimum F0
                   automatically. The implementation of the Momel
                   algorithm incorporates a greatly improved treatment
                   of the modelling of pitch contours in the vicinity of
                   onsets and offsets of voicing. The version of the
                   INTSINT algorithm implemented is the two parameter
                   robust version which has been described in recent
                   publications.},

                   autosegmental-metrical (AM) theory of intonational
                   phonology. AM posits that at the phonological level
                   intonation consists of a string of L(ow) and H(igh)
                   tones (i.e. a string of tonal autosegments) that
                   associate with metrical heads and phrasal boundaries.
                   Phonetically, tones are realized as tonal targets,
                   specific f0 points defined by their scaling and
                   alignment; scaling refers to the pitch height of the
                   tonal target, and alignment to the synchronization of
                   the target with the segmental material that reflects
                   its phonological association (typically stressed
                   syllables and boundary-adjacent syllables). The
                   chapter explains these essential tenets of AM in some
                   detail and discusses how they differ from those of
                   other models of intonation and what consequences
                   these differences have for modelling and predicting
                   the realization of pitch contours. The chapter
                   presents the basics of phonological representation
                   and phonetic modelling in AM, and briefly touches on
                   intonational meaning and AM applications.},

  abstract =      {Much of what is known about prosody is based on
                   native speaker intuitions of idealized speech, or on
                   prosodic annotations from trained annotators whose
                   auditory impressions are augmented by visual evidence
                   from speech waveforms, spectrograms and pitch tracks.
                   Expanding the prosodic data currently available to
                   cover more languages, and to cover a broader range of
                   unscripted speech styles, is prohibitive due to the
                   time, money and human expertise needed for prosodic
                   annotation. We describe an alternative approach to
                   prosodic data collection, with coarse-grained
                   annotations from a cohort of untrained annotators
                   performing rapid prosody transcription (RPT) using
                   LMEDS, an open-source software tool we developed to
                   enable large-scale, crowd-sourced data collection
                   with RPT. Results from three RPT experiments are
                   reported. The reliability of RPT is analysed
                   comparing kappa statistics for lab-based and
                   crowd-sourced annotations for American English,
                   comparing annotators from the same (US) versus
                   different (Indian) dialect groups, and comparing each
                   RPT annotator with a ToBI annotation. Results show
                   better reliability for same-dialect annotators (US),
                   and the best overall reliability from crowd-sourced
                   US annotators, though lab-based annotations are the
                   most similar to ToBI annotations. A generalized
                   additive mixed model is used to test differences
                   among annotator groups in the factors that predict
                   prosodic annotation. Results show that a common set
                   of acoustic and contextual factors predict prosodic
                   labels for all annotator groups, with only small
                   differences among the RPT groups, but with larger
                   effects on prosodic marking for ToBI annotators. The
                   findings suggest methods for optimizing the
                   efficiency of RPT annotations. Overall, crowd-sourced
                   prosodic annotation is shown to be efficient, and to
                   rely on established cues to prosody, supporting its
                   use for prosody research across languages, dialects,
                   speaker populations, and speech genres.},
