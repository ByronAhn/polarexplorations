@article{braun06,
	abstract = {It is acknowledged that contrast plays an important role in understanding discourse and information structure. While it is commonly assumed that contrast can be marked by intonation only, our understanding of the intonational realization of contrast is limited. For German there is mainly introspective evidence that the rising theme accent (or topic accent) is realized differently when signaling contrast than when not. In this article, the acoustic basis for the reported impressionistic differences is investigated in terms of the scaling (height) and alignment (positioning) of tonal targets.Subjects read target sentences in a contrastive and a noncontrastive context (Experiment 1). Prosodic annotation revealed that thematic accents were not realized with different accent types in the two contexts but acoustic comparison showed that themes in contrastive context exhibited a higher and later peak. The alignment and scaling of accents can hence be controlled in a linguistically meaningful way, which has implications for intonational phonology. In Experiment 2, nonlinguists' perception of a subset of the production data was assessed. They had to choose whether, in a contrastive context, the presumed contrastive or noncontrastive realization of a sentence was more appropriate. For some sentence pairs only, subjects had a clear preference. For Experiment 3, a group of linguists annotated the thematic accents of the contrastive and noncontrastive versions of the same data as used in Experiment 2. There was considerable disagreement in labels, but different accent types were consistently used when the two versions differed strongly in F0 excursion. Although themes in contrastive contexts were clearly produced differently than themes in noncontrastive contexts, this difference is not easily perceived or annotated.},

	abstract = {The intonational realization of utterances is generally characterized by regional as well as inter- and intra-speaker variability in f0. Category boundaries thus remain ``fuzzy'' and it is non-trivial how the (continuous) acoustic space maps onto (discrete) pitch accent categories. We focus on three types of rising-falling contours, which differ in the alignment of L(ow) and H(igh) tones with respect to the stressed syllable. Most of the intonational systems on German have described two rising accent categories, e.g., L+H* and L*+H in the German ToBI system. L+H* has a high-pitched stressed syllable and a low leading tone aligned in the pre-tonic syllable; L*+H a low-pitched stressed syllable and a high trailing tone in the post-tonic syllable. There are indications for the existence of a third category which lies between these two categories, with both L and H aligned within the stressed syllable, henceforth termed (LH)*. In the present paper, we empirically investigate the distinctiveness of three rising-falling contours [L+H*, (LH)*, and L*+H, all with a subsequent low boundary tone] in German wh-questions. We employ an approach that addresses both the form and the function of the contours, also taking regional variation into account. In Experiment 1 (form), we used a delayed imitation paradigm to test whether Northern and Southern German speakers can imitate the three rising-falling contours in wh-questions as distinct contours. In Experiment 2 (function), we used a free association task to investigate whether listeners interpret the pragmatic meaning of the three contours differently. Imitation results showed that German speakers\textemdash both from the North and the South\textemdash reproduced the three contours. There was a small but significant effect of regional variety such that contours produced by speakers from the North were slightly more distinct than those by speakers from the South. In the association task, listeners from both varieties attributed distinct meanings to the (LH)* accent as opposed to the two ToBI accents L+H* and L*+H. Combined evidence from form and function suggests that three distinct contours can be found in the acoustic and perceptual space of German rising-falling contours.},

@book{roessig21,
	abstract = {Prosody has been characterised as a "half-tamed savage" being shaped by both discrete, categorical aspects as well as gradient, continuous phenomena. This book is concerned with the relation of the "wild" and the "tamed" sides of prosodic prominence. It reviews problems that arise from a strict separation of categorical and continuous representations in models of phonetics and phonology, and it explores the potential role of descriptions aimed at reconciling the two domains. In doing so, the book offers an introduction to dynamical systems, a framework that has been studied extensively in the last decades to model speech production and perception. The reported acoustic and articulatory data presented in this book show that categorical and continuous modulations used to enhance prosodic prominence are deeply intertwined and even exhibit a kind of symbiosis. A multi-dimensional dynamical model of prosodic prominence is sketched, based on the empirical data, combining tonal and articulatory aspects of prosodic focus marking. The model demonstrates how categorical and continuous aspects can be inte- grated in a joint theoretical treatment that overcomes a strict separation of phonetics and phonology.},

	abstract = {The results of published research critically depend on methodological decisions that have been made during data analysis. These so-called `researcher degrees of freedom' (Simmons, Nelson, \&amp; Simonsohn, 2011) can affect the results and the conclusions researchers draw from it. It is argued that phonetic research faces a large number of researcher degrees of freedom due to its scientific object\textemdash speech\textemdash being inherently multidimensional and exhibiting complex interactions between multiple covariates. A Type-I error simulation is presented that demonstrates the severe inflation of false positives when exploring researcher degrees of freedom. It is argued that combined with common cognitive fallacies, exploitation of researcher degrees of freedom introduces strong bias and poses a serious challenge to quantitative phonetics as an empirical science. This paper discusses potential remedies for this problem including adjusting the threshold for significance; drawing a clear line between confirmatory and exploratory analyses via preregistration; open, honest, and transparent practices in communicating data analytical decisions; and direct replications.},

	abstract = {At the heart of the KIM is a phonological system. It is probably the only system to date that explicitly includes phonological levels of perceptual prominence, next to the phonological categories of intonation and phrasing that are offered by many other models as well. But the KIM as a whole is even larger. It also takes phenomena such as speech rate, pitch register, and types of disfluencies into account that often extend across several prosodic phrases. However, this chapter focuses on phonological categories that are associated with the domain of the prosodic phrase; it does so to comply with the maximum number of words and because almost all research and labeling within the KIM framework so far has been concerned with these phrase-level categories. As this chapter provides the first extensive summary of the KIM after almost twenty years, the revised phonological system differs quite a bit from Kohler's early system presentations.},

@article{kosling+13,
	abstract = {According to the widely accepted Lexical Category Prominence Rule (LCPR), prominence assignment to triconstituent compounds depends on the branching direction. Left-branching compounds, that is, compounds with a left-hand complex constituent, are held to have highest prominence on the left-most constituent, whereas right-branching compounds have highest prominence on the second of the three constituents. The LCPR is, however, only poorly empirically supported. The present paper tests a new hypothesis concerning the prominence of triconstituent compounds and suggests a new methodology for the empirical investigation of compound prominence. According to this hypothesis, the prominence pattern of the embedded compound has a decisive influence on the prominence of the whole compound. Using a mixed-effects generalized additive model for the analysis of the pitch movements, it is shown that all triconstituent compounds have an accent on the first constituent irrespective of branching, and that the placement of a second, or even a third, accent is dependent on the prominence pattern of the embedded compound. The LCPR is wrong.},

	abstract = {It has already been observed that there is no one-to-one mapping between intonational categories and the pragmatic functions they are used to express. For instance, in German a particular pitch accent (L+H{${_\ast}$}) is often used to express contrastive (corrective) focus, but neither is the use of this pitch accent confined to this function nor is this the only pitch accent used to express it. In particular, there are considerable differences across speakers in the use of pitch accents and the functions they express. In this paper we look at the phonetic parameters that are characteristic of each of these pitch accents (f0 peak alignment, tonal onglide and target height) and observe a striking similarity across speakers: All speakers modulate each parameter in the same direction, e.g. the f0 peak is aligned later for contrastive focus than for narrow focus. Whereas for some speakers this is transcribed as two different pitch accents (L+H{${_\ast}$} vs. H{${_\ast}$}), for others it is not, and the peak alignment is treated as phonetic variation within one accent type (H{${_\ast}$}). To capture both the differences and similarities in intonation, we therefore argue for an integrated analysis of the discrete phonological pitch accents and the modulation of continuous phonetic parameters that characterise them.},

	abstract = {The perception of prosodic prominence in spontaneous speech is investigated through an online task of prosody transcription using untrained listeners. Prominence is indexed through a probabilistic prominence score assigned to each word based on the proportion of transcribers who perceived the word as prominent. Correlation and regression analyses between perceived prominence, acoustic measures and measures of a word's information status are conducted to test three hypotheses: (i) prominence perception is signal-driven, influenced by acoustic factors reflecting speakers' productions; (ii) perception is expectation-driven, influenced by the listener's prior experience of word frequency and repetition; (iii) any observed influence of word frequency on perceived prominence is mediated through the acoustic signal. Results show correlates of perceived prominence in acoustic measures, in word log-frequency and in the repetition index of a word, consistent with both signal-driven and expectation-driven hypotheses of prominence perception. But the acoustic correlates of perceived prominence differ somewhat from the correlates of word frequency, suggesting an independent effect of frequency on prominence perception. A speech processing account is offered as a model of signal-driven and expectation-driven effects on prominence perception, where prominence ratings are a function of the ease of lexical processing, as measured through the activation levels of lexical and sub-lexical units.},

I argue that this remains an unresolved issue because of the assumed direct and invariant relationship between abstract tonal categories and F0, which is treated as intonation's only exponent. New findings and modelling from my own research programme together with documented typological diversity inform a revised understanding of the relation between abstract intonational structure and phonetic realization. This body of work shows that tonal events are comparable to segments: they are realized by a number of phonetic dimensions that exhibit within-category variability and cross-category overlap, and are in trading relationships with each other. Recognizing the variable realization of tonal events requires that we relax the invariance criterion, and accept that (a) the relationship between intonation and F0 is not straightforward, and (b) intonational meaning is critical for determining intonational categories.},

Phonetically, tones are realized as tonal targets, specific f0 points defined by their scaling and alignment; scaling refers to the pitch height of the tonal target, and alignment to the synchronization of the target with the segmental material that reflects its phonological association (typically stressed syllables and boundary-adjacent syllables). The chapter explains these essential tenets of AM in some detail and discusses how they differ from those of other models of intonation and what consequences these differences have for modelling and predicting the realization of pitch contours. The chapter presents the basics of phonological representation and phonetic modelling in AM, and briefly touches on intonational meaning and AM applications.},

The object of study in the project is the prosody of dialogue in a language technology framework. The specific goal of our research is to increase our understanding of how the prosodic aspects of speech are exploited interactively in dialogue---the genuine environment for prosody---and on the basis of this increased knowledge to be able to create a more powerful prosody model. In this paper we give an overview of project design and methods and present some tentative findings.},

@article{cole-17,
	abstract = {Much of what is known about prosody is based on native speaker intuitions of idealized speech, or on prosodic annotations from trained annotators whose auditory impressions are augmented by visual evidence from speech waveforms, spectrograms and pitch tracks. Expanding the prosodic data currently available to cover more languages, and to cover a broader range of unscripted speech styles, is prohibitive due to the time, money and human expertise needed for prosodic annotation. We describe an alternative approach to prosodic data collection, with coarse-grained annotations from a cohort of untrained annotators performing rapid prosody transcription (RPT) using LMEDS, an open-source software tool we developed to enable large-scale, crowd-sourced data collection with RPT. Results from three RPT experiments are reported. The reliability of RPT is analysed comparing kappa statistics for lab-based and crowd-sourced annotations for American English, comparing annotators from the same (US) versus different (Indian) dialect groups, and comparing each RPT annotator with a ToBI annotation. Results show better reliability for same-dialect annotators (US), and the best overall reliability from crowd-sourced US annotators, though lab-based annotations are the most similar to ToBI annotations. A generalized additive mixed model is used to test differences among annotator groups in the factors that predict prosodic annotation. Results show that a common set of acoustic and contextual factors predict prosodic labels for all annotator groups, with only small differences among the RPT groups, but with larger effects on prosodic marking for ToBI annotators. The findings suggest methods for optimizing the efficiency of RPT annotations. Overall, crowd-sourced prosodic annotation is shown to be efficient, and to rely on established cues to prosody, supporting its use for prosody research across languages, dialects, speaker populations, and speech genres.},

@incollection{hirst07,
	abstract = {This paper presents a revised version of an implementation of the Momel and INTSINT algorithms for the automatic modelling and symbolic coding of intonation patterns. The algorithms are implemented as external functions (respectively a C program and a Perl script), which are seamlessly integrated into the Praat speech manipulation software by means of the recently proposed plugin facility for Praat. Pitch detection is carried out using a subroutine to calculate optimal values of maximum and minimum F0 automatically. The implementation of the Momel algorithm incorporates a greatly improved treatment of the modelling of pitch contours in the vicinity of onsets and offsets of voicing. The version of the INTSINT algorithm implemented is the two parameter robust version which has been described in recent publications.},
