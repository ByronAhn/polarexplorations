                   research is to increase our understanding of how the
                   prosodic aspects of speech are exploited
                   interactively in dialogue---the genuine environment
                   for prosody---and on the basis of this increased
                   knowledge to be able to create a more powerful
                   prosody model. In this paper we give an overview of
                   project design and methods and present some tentative
